This repository contains the implementation of  **SSTT**.  Pre-trained models are provided in  `./trained_models`. You can run `python evaluate.py` to reproduce the results of our experiments on Ubuntu 18.04. We will open all source code soon. The val and test datasets are available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eKWLMyWwsbJ9sRmVC1uY1g.
